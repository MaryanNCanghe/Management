    title:'Hand and Mouth',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: hand1,
    description: 'This painting depicts a hand gripping my mouth aggressively, silencing a wide-open screaming an embodiment of oppression and suffocation. The vivid red background amplifies the intensity of the emotion, reflecting the internal chaos that felt overpowering and inescapable. It speaks to the suffocating grip of depression, where pain becomes voiceless, and the struggle to be heard feels futile.',

    title:'Hand and Stripe',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: hand2,
    description: 'The second painting portrays a hand desperately reaching for a blood red stripe, begging for help amidst the void. The black background swallows the scene, emphasizing the hopelessness and isolation that surrounded me. It´s a cry for rescue, yet the grasp remains unfulfilled, capturing the feeling of seeking a solution when none seems attainable.',

    title:' Strenght',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: hand3,
    description: 'The third painting, in contrast, is a portrayal of fierce determination, a hand clenched tightly, embodying power and resilience. Yet despite its strength, it feels trapped in the same darkness, as if fighting against an invisible force that never truly loosens its grip. It represents the relentless effort to overcome the abyss while feeling endlessly stuck within it.',

    title:'They staring at me',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: heads,
    description: 'They Staring at Me, is about the quiet, trembling act of letting certain people into my life. Not because they earned it. Not because they understood me. But because I let them. It is about the weight of being seen by them not perfectly, but closely enough to matter. The stares in this painting are not just eyes, they are memories and moments. This is not about connection or clarity. It is about vulnerability, the raw, fragile space I gave them access to.',

    title:'My street',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: street,
    description: 'During my struggle with depression, this view became a constant in my life, something I could hold onto amid the chaos within. It was both comforting and haunting, reminding me that the world kept moving even when I felt stuck. Each morning, as I stood there waiting for the bus, I absorbed the stillness of the scene, letting it ground me, as if the sky and the trees were silently offering me solace.',

    id: 6,
    title:'Innocence',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: innocence,
    description: 'This painting is a bold and unflinching declaration of liberation and defiance. It features a raw and vulnerable portrait, exposed body, legs wide open, yet the head is concealed beneath a nun´s head covering. The stark contrast between nudity and religious symbolism challenges the viewer to confront the tension between purity and human desire. It symbolizes my journey from repression to self-acceptance, confronting the guilt and shame that religion imprinted. The posture, unapologetically open, is a rebellious statement',

    title:'Paris Room',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: hotel,
    description: 'Paris Room is a quiet portrait of someone who once meant a great deal to me. Painted in soft whites and muted tones, it captures a fleeting, intimate moment, him sleeping, unaware, in the stillness of a bed. There is a gentle distance in the composition, like watching a memory fade in slow motion, The choice of a white palette was deliberate, white as absence, white as softness, white as everything we did not say. This piece holds a certain kind of peace, but also the weight of transience. It is about being close and loved by someone and still knowing they can not be there forever. This painting is more about how it felt to be there. To witness, to care, and to let go.',

    title:'Childhood',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: sky,
    description: 'This painting captures the pure innocence and freedom of childhood, with naked children jumping freely in the blue sky. They represents the untainted, unburdened nature of youth, where joy is found in simple, unspoken moments. The sky, vast and endless, symbolizes heaven itself an ethereal space where innocence is free to soar without limits. In this piece, I explore the beauty of being untouched by the complexities of life, reminding us of the purity we are born with.',

    title:'Cornrows',
    category: 'Painting',
    imageUrl: cornrows,
    description: 'As an African woman, I have always struggled with the traditional style of cornrows-something that has been an iconic symbol of African beauty and heritage. In my personal experience, I found it difficult to connect with this style. This painting is a reflection of my journey to understand and embrace my roots more fully. By confronting my feelings of rejection, I am beginning to see cornrows not just as a hairstyle, but as a deep cultural and ancestral symbol. It´s a way for me to reconnect with my history, my lineage, and the beauty that flows through generations.',

    imageUrl: florest,
    description: 'This piece holds a deeply personal significance to me. It is a tribute to a cherished memory of my father, who passed away. One night, I dreamt of him running through a forest just like this one, full of life and movement, as if time had paused to preserve that fleeting moment. Painting this forest became my way of capturing that dream, preserving it as a memory that I never want to fade. The night forest symbolizes both the mystery of loss and the comfort of remembering. It´s a place where dreams and reality blur, where I can hold onto that brief, precious connection with him.',
